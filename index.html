    <h1>Rube Goldburg machine cad</h1>
    <H3>    First we had to open up a website named  <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard">tinkercad </a> after we opened up the website one of our group members made a new  project and selected the 3d design option. After he did that he emailed all of the group the link to the <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0gkpNQSe7IR-tremendous-turing-maimu/edit?sharecode=_Xrcu908EvcX5yBNtz1iDOcG26riviwFrUWCicVwFDA">cad</a>,after that we were all able to work on the project together. The cad consisted of a baseball traveling down two slopes then rolling on to a seesaw. The seesaw would hit a peice of cardboard that had a needle attached to it, the catdboard was tie to a string and the string and cardboard would hit the baloon and pop. We worked on the cad for about one day and on the second day we were almost finished and were putting on some finishing touches. </H3>
    <h1><marquee>Materials</marquee></h1>
    <h3>    Once we were finished with the cad it was finally time to start building. Each group had a ruler a box cutter and two siccors in our group box. Each group was able to use a cutting board to protect the table, cardboard and some duct tape. All periods were able to use baseballs, they could also bring their own to use how ever they wanted. Groups were able to bring other things from home but were limited to it.</h3>
    <h1><Marquee>Making the machine</Marquee></h1>
    <h3>    On the first day we started with the base and the slope. while we started this we ran into our first problem, the cads measurements were way to big to be made in the time we had. to solve this problem we cut each measurment on the cad in half and used those instead. We were making the base and the slope and we were almost done, while the rest of the group were finishing the slope and base I started making the seesaw to make the seesaw I needed to make a triangle the same width as the base so it would line up correctly. After I made the triangle I traced another and made a rectagle that matched up with the stiangles. after that I made a rectagle that would sit ontop of the triangles and be the actual seesaw. during this procces we ran into another problem. the rectangle on top of the triangles would not balance, so we had to find a solution. a solution we came up with was to take a peice of cardboard and make a fold into it we would then tape the cardboard to the side of the seesaw that would be bending and the cardboard propt the rectagle up and stil allowed it to slope down when the basbeall rolled onto it. After that we were faced with another problem with the seesaw, the seesaw was weighed down by the baseball and was starting to shape down and stay down. Our group put a big peice of ductape on the rectangle and folded it onto eachother so the rectangle would stay aligned where the baseball would drop off.</h3>
    <h3>    we were done with half of the machine and we had now make the pedistole that the needle would sit on before it was hit by the seesaw. the measurements were very big so we also had to cut them in half wich solved that issue. then we had to make the collom that would have the string and needle connected to it. we decided on making two triangles and having where the points connect be where the string was attached. during this procces we ran into an issue the triangles were too short and if they were tall enough there would be no space for the baloon to stay at to be popped. instead of the triangles we made a long rectangle witha point at the end. with this shape there will be space for the string to be attached and for the balloon to sit. after fixing that we ran into the biggest issue of the project. the cardboard and string that was attache dto the pedestol would not stay strait and woudl swing around in the air and could not pop the baloon. Our first solution was to attach another string to the pin. The pin still had the same problem we relised that the pin even though it was light it was affecting the way the cardboard moved. We poked the pin through the cardboard and had the pin stick to the other side.</h3>
    <h3>    Now that we had that problem fixed we tested it. The ball rolled down the slope and onto the seesaw, the seesaw hit the cardboard and the pin swung... The pin <b>HIT</b>the baloon, and did not pop. we found out that at the end of the slope there is a peice of cardboard that is slowing teh ball down and making the seesaw lift with less power. We fixed that and tested the machine, everything worked perfect but we didn't want anything to go wrong se for extra speed we put a peice of tape at the ledge were the pin and cardboard sat. This peice of tape created friction so the pin would swing faster.

    <hr> <h1>9/22-9/27</h1>
    <h2>9/22</h2><h3>On friday there was no wifi in our classroom so we had to go to Mr.Kim's math classroom wich had wifi,we watched his slides and filled in the blanks onthe worksheet he handed out. The worksheet was on computer engineering, the new subject we will be learning. Computer engineering is the merge of computer science and electronic engineering. Computer engineering consists of embedded systems, computer visions,integrated circuits, firmware developing, computer architecture, and quantum computing. Another thing we learned was Moore's Law, Moores law is the law that every 2 years the number of transistors must double. A transistor is a miniature semi conducter that regulates voltage flow in a computer. We also learned about the components of a computer, a computer has a motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), random accese memory (RAM), storage (HDD,FLASH,ETC), and graphic card (GPU).</h3>
    <h2>9/25</h2><h3>On moday we put in journal entrys to our websites, for our rube goldburg machines. Some people needed more time so we used this day to do enrys.</h3>
    <h2>9/27</h2><h3>On wednesday we disected a computer. There was a slide show that we had to follow. We were given a screwdriver, container and extchangerble bits. We had to take out the Motherboard, Cpu,Gpu,Ram stick, fan cover,and disk drive. We had to start by taking off the cover then the side panel that covered the disk drive. then we had to lift the box up from its case. We had to unplug all the cords that we had to unplug, we had to then take out the disk drive.After that was out we had to take out the RAM stick from its case. then we had to remove the fan cover, under the cover was the fan and metal beast. We had to unscrew some screws from the bottom and remove the beast. under the beast was a cpu we had to take out the cpu and then we had to unscrew the screws from the Motherboard. We were able to take off the Mother board and we were done. After disecting the computer we had to put it all back and then we were offically done. </h3>
    
    
    
    <h2>Bioengineering</h2>
    <p><h3>     Our next unit was bioengineering, bioengineering is the application of biology and the tools used in engineering. Bioengineering is a combonation of many different engineering pathways. A couple pathways used are Chemical engineering, physics, mathmatics and statistics. There are 5 main career options that come just from bioengineering, bioformatics, biomechanics, biomaterial, tissue/genetic engineering, and medical divices. There are many uses for bioengineering, two uses are prosthetics, and tissue engineering. An example of a prosthetic is a heart.</h3></p>

    <h2><i>Biomimicry</i></h2>
    <h3>another branch of bioengineering is biomimicry. Biomimicry is the study of mimicking biology living organismsto benifit our devices (spiderman). A way humans can use biomimicry is spiders webs. A problem in the world right now is clothes being wasted, and a shortage in silk. A way we could solve this problem is using a substance as strong and common as spider webs.</h3>
    <h2><i>The Project</i></h2>
    <h3>Our project for this unit was to make a prosthetic hand with cardboard, rubber bands, and tape. The task was to mathe a hand that works well enough to pick up an empty water bottle (its harder than you think). My first idea was to make a hand shape out of cardboard, wrap a rubberband around each finger and tape them to a ruler and be able to pull the ruler to close the fingers. I was able to make the hand with this idea but the rubber bands would stretch and prevent the fingers from closing fully, to fix this a put a peice of tape on the palm where each ruberband would touch adn made a small hole for the rubberband to go through. This solved the problem about half way, the rubberbands were letting the fingers bend more but were still held back by the rubber band slighlty. I asked my teacher how to fix this, and he suggested to put the rubber bands onth eback of the hand. I tried this by cutting a hole in the middle of the palm and pushed the rubberbands through. we only had one class to do this so by the time I did this the class was almost over so I couldent make any adjustments.</h3>

    <h2>Aerospace Engineering</h2>
    <h3>After we did our Bioengineering unit we started a new unit Aerospace engineering. This branch of engineering invollves the design, manufaturing, and science of aircraft and spacecraft. Aerospace engineering has to branches aeronautical, and astronautical. Aeronautical focuses on aircrafts missles and some rockets that stay in the earths orbit. Astronautical focuses on spacecraft, satellites and some rockets that leave the Earthe's orbit. Aerospace engineering focuses on 4 things, Structural design, navigation and control, guidence, and instrumentation. Some of the design diciplines that that come with aerospace engineering are thermodynamics, aerodynamics, propulsion, guidence and control systems, acoustics, and celestial mechanics. did you know that in 1903 the Wright brothers performed the first sustained controlled flight of a powered heavier than air aircraft! The performance lasted 12 seconds. </h3>

    <h3>There are four main fources on aircrafts, drag, weight, lift, and thrust. Drag goes in the opposite direction of motion wich slows the aircraft down. The thrust moves in the direction of motion, wich is the way the aircraft is going. Weight is the force of gravity that points in the diection of earths center. Liftis the force that is at a right angle of the direction of motion.
    Drag is the friction of the aircraft in the air. Lift is the differece of pressure below and above the aircraftwhile moving in a direction.</h3>
    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <h3>The project we were assigned was to make a bottle rocket out of a two liter bottle. The materials we were given for this project were cardboard, tape, string(for a parachute) and a pencil(for the launch rail) and hot glue. There were not enough bottles for everyone so there were a couple groups of 4 that shared one bottle. the first thing we had to do was to follow the measurements on our cad, we started off by making the wings of the rocket. We curved the wings to fit the bottle, then we made the cone. We tried to make the cone with cardboard but the cone was bumpy and didn't fit the bottle right. We had to think of a different way to make the cone, time was running out so we had to change the cone to be made with paper. This cone fit better and was flat. After we were finished with the cone and wings we glued the pencil to the bottle, the pencil was used to slide off the launch rail that would attach to the bottle. Mr.Kim suggested to use a certain pencil because it slide off the rail better and would have a better result. We attached a coke wrapper to the bottle as a joke of Coke sponsering the rocket. The next time we met it was time to launch the rocket, we went down to the middle field and the launcher was set up. The way the launch worked was that a machine would feed air into the rocket, then we would turn the machine off after it hit 70 psi. After that Mr.Kim would let go of the bottle, then the bottle would launch. <img src="Bottle Rocket.jpeg" </h3>
