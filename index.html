    <h1>Rube Goldburg machine cad</h1>
    <H3>    First we had to open up a website named  <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard">tinkercad </a> after we opened up the website one of our group members made a new  project and selected the 3d design option. After he did that he emailed all of the group the link to the <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0gkpNQSe7IR-tremendous-turing-maimu/edit?sharecode=_Xrcu908EvcX5yBNtz1iDOcG26riviwFrUWCicVwFDA">cad</a>,after that we were all able to work on the project together. The cad consisted of a baseball traveling down two slopes then rolling on to a seesaw. The seesaw would hit a peice of cardboard that had a needle attached to it, the catdboard was tie to a string and the string and cardboard would hit the baloon and pop. We worked on the cad for about one day and on the second day we were almost finished and were putting on some finishing touches. </H3>

    <h3>    Once we were finished with the cad it was finally time to start building. Each group had a ruler a box cutter and two siccors in our group box. Each group was able to use a cutting board to protect the table, cardboard and some duct tape. All periods were able to use baseballs, they could also bring their own to use how ever they wanted. Groups were able to bring other things from home but were limited to it.</h3>
    <h1><Marquee>Making the machine</Marquee></h1>
    <h3>    On the first day we started with the base and the slope. while we started this we ran into our first problem, the cads measurements were way to big to be made in the time we had. to solve this problem we cut each measurment on the cad in half and used those instead. We were making the base and the slope and we were almost done, while the rest of the group were finishing the slope and base I started making the seesaw to make the seesaw I needed to make a triangle the same width as the base so it would line up correctly. After I made the triangle I traced another and made a rectagle that matched up with the stiangles. after that I made a rectagle that would sit ontop of the triangles and be the actual seesaw. during this procces we ran into another problem. the rectangle on top of the triangles would not balance, so we had to find a solution. a solution we came up with was to take a peice of cardboard and make a fold into it we would then tape the cardboard to the side of the seesaw that would be bending and the cardboard propt the rectagle up and stil allowed it to slope down when the basbeall rolled onto it. After that we were faced with another problem with the seesaw, the seesaw was weighed down by the baseball and was starting to shape down and stay down. Our group put a big peice of ductape on the rectangle and folded it onto eachother so the rectangle would stay aligned where the baseball would drop off.</h3>
    <h3>    we were done with half of the machine and we had now make the pedistole that the needle would sit on before it was hit by the seesaw. the measurements were very big so we also had to cut them in half wich solved that issue. then we had to make the collom that would have the string and needle connected to it. we decided on making two triangles and having where the points connect be where the string was attached. during this procces we ran into an issue the triangles were too short and if they were tall enough there would be no space for the baloon to stay at to be popped. instead of the triangles we made a long rectangle witha point at the end. with this shape there will be space for the string to be attached and for the balloon to sit. after fixing that we ran into the biggest issue of the project. the cardboard and string that was attache dto the pedestol would not stay strait and woudl swing around in the air and could not pop the baloon. Our first solution was to attach another string to the pin. The pin still had the same problem we relised that the pin even though it was light it was affecting the way the cardboard moved. We poked the pin through the cardboard and had the pin stick to the other side.</h3>
    <h3>    Now that we had that problem fixed we tested it. The ball rolled down the slope and onto the seesaw, the seesaw hit the cardboard and the pin swung... The pin <b>HIT</b>the baloon, and did not pop. we found out that at the end of the slope there is a peice of cardboard that is slowing teh ball down and making the seesaw lift with less power. We fixed that and tested the machine, everything worked perfect but we didn't want anything to go wrong se for extra speed we put a peice of tape at the ledge were the pin and cardboard sat. This peice of tape created friction so the pin would swing faster.

    <hr> <h1>9/22-9/27</h1>
    <h2>9/22</h2><h3>On friday there was no wifi in our classroom so we had to go to Mr.Kim's math classroom wich had wifi,we watched his slides and filled in the blanks onthe worksheet he handed out. The worksheet was on computer engineering, the new subject we will be learning. Computer engineering is the merge of computer science and electronic engineering. Computer engineering consists of embedded systems, computer visions,integrated circuits, firmware developing, computer architecture, and quantum computing. Another thing we learned was Moore's Law, Moores law is the law that every 2 years the number of transistors must double. A transistor is a miniature semi conducter that regulates voltage flow in a computer. We also learned about the components of a computer, a computer has a motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), random accese memory (RAM), storage (HDD,FLASH,ETC), and graphic card (GPU).</h3>
    <h2>9/25</h2><h3>On moday we put in journal entrys to our websites, for our rube goldburg machines. Some people needed more time so we used this day to do enrys.</h3>
    <h2>9/27</h2><h3>On wednesday we disected a computer. There was a slide show that we had to follow. We were given a screwdriver, container and extchangerble bits. We had to take out the Motherboard, Cpu,Gpu,Ram stick, fan cover,and disk drive. We had to start by taking off the cover then the side panel that covered the disk drive. then we had to lift the box up from its case. We had to unplug all the cords that we had to unplug, we had to then take out the disk drive.After that was out we had to take out the RAM stick from its case. then we had to remove the fan cover, under the cover was the fan and metal beast. We had to unscrew some screws from the bottom and remove the beast. under the beast was a cpu we had to take out the cpu and then we had to unscrew the screws from the Motherboard. We were able to take off the Mother board and we were done. After disecting the computer we had to put it all back and then we were offically done. </h3>
