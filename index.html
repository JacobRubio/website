    <h1>Rube Goldburg machine cad</h1>
    <H3>    First we had to open up a website named  <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard">tinkercad </a> after we opened up the website one of our group members made a new  project and selected the 3d design option. After he did that he emailed all of the group the link to the <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0gkpNQSe7IR-tremendous-turing-maimu/edit?sharecode=_Xrcu908EvcX5yBNtz1iDOcG26riviwFrUWCicVwFDA">cad</a>,after that we were all able to work on the project together. The cad consisted of a baseball traveling down two slopes then rolling on to a seasaw. The seasaw would hit a peice of cardboard that had a needle attached to it, the catdboard was tie to a string and the string and cardboard would hit the baloon and pop. we worked on the cad for about one day and on the second day we were almost finished and were putting on some finishing touches. </H3>
    <h1>Materials</h1>
    <h3>    Once we were finishe dwith the cad it was finally time to start building. Each group had a ruler a box cutter and two siccors in our group box. Each group was able to use a cutting board to protect the table, cardboard and some duct tape. All periods were able to use baseballs, they could also bring their own to use how ever they wanted. Groups were able to bring other things from home but were limitedto it.</h3>
    <h1>Making the machine</h1>
    <h3>    On the first day we started with the base and the slope. while we started this we ran into our first problem, the cads measurements were way to big to be made in the time we had. to solve this problem we cut each measurment on the cad in half and used those instead. </h3>
